<h4 align="center">About me</h4>
<div>
<p>🔭 I’m currently developing some projects that allow me to experiment with new ideas and learn new technical skills.</p>
<p>🌱 I’m continuously working to deepen my knowledge and grow as a developer.</p>
<p>🤖 I’m learning how to integrate AI tools in my workflow in a effective, and responsible manner.</p>
<p>🎨 I’m also exploring design as a personal interest. I’ve always been drawn to visual composition and narrative. I take photographies as a hobby and I love cinema.</p>
